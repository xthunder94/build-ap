      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>To allow modules to be shared without RPC, PHP was chosen as the language to retrieve, parse, and display data. First, the settings.php file is modified with the correct API Key. Next, the scripts in the fetch folder are executed to retrieve match information as well as static data and are stored in MongoDB. The scripts in Machine Learning are then executed to interpret the data and the conclusions are stored in another collection within MongoDB. The frontend website then retrieves the data from the database and displays it to the user.</p>

      <h2>About</h1>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this project is to compare how AP items are being utilized before and after the 5.11/5.14 patch. Since core AP items are being tweaked, all AP champions will be affected by this change. This website lists out the winrates of mid lane champions as well as the damage they have dealt. In addition, each item is evaluated for its win potential as well as how often it is being used.</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>To allow modules to be shared without RPC, PHP was chosen as the language to retrieve, parse, and display data. First, the settings.php file is modified with the correct API Key. Next, the scripts in the fetch folder are executed to retrieve match information as well as static data and are stored in MongoDB. The scripts in Machine Learning are then executed to interpret the data and the conclusions are stored in another collection within MongoDB. The frontend website then retrieves the data from the database and displays it to the user.</p>
